<h1>Project page for: Scott Sykora</h1>

<p>I am available for most any time, as I do not have a job to work around.  This is my sole focus, so I am quite flexible.  
  If someone else has an ideal time, I can work around that.</p>

<p>I am not sure how much help my elevator pitches will be as they are fairly large projects, but here it goes:</p>

<h3>My top three elevator pitches would be:</h3>

<p>
  1. For [Cell phone photography or any photographic device] 
who [needs long term storage for photos] 
the [Photography Vault] 
is a [photography preservation tool] 
that [photos uploaded from phone to long term cloud storage for management and viewing in a browser.  Ownership of vault given to beneficiary upon death of user].
Unlike [google photos where dormant accounts are deleted after two years]
our product [preserves a clear path for ownership of virtual property to the next generation].
</p>

<p>
  2. For [any person]
 who [would like to see the best arguments pro/con on any idea or product]
 the [Arena of Ideas]
 is a [debate platform]
 that [gives every side of a debate or issue the ability to rate and vote for top arguments for competing ideas.  Every poster will need to give the top strengths/weaknesses of   his ideas].
 Unlike [websites like Redditt or Facebook that are echo chambers on single sided ideas or are moderated on single side ideals]
 our product [will, over time, have the pros and cons of ideas or creeds listed side by side with all sides cross checked and cross examined].
</p>

<p>
  3. For [a business owner or individual] 
 who [who would be able to use a food product needing to be used or disposed] 
 the [Produce Truck] 
 is a [food products disposal clearinghouse] 
 that [gives producers a place to list commercial sized amounts of food that are available]. 
 Unlike [sending it to landfills, which happens in large cities (I know firsthand)]
 our product [offers a central clearinghouse for purchasers a place to bid on food products that are near expiration date.  Maybe a cannery, or frozen food, or pig farm may be able to use the item].
