<h1>Project page for: Scott Sykora</h1>

<p>I am available for most any time, as I do not have a job to work around.  This is my sole focus, so I am quite flexible.  
  If someone else has an ideal time, I can work around that.</p>

<p>I am not sure how much help my elevator pitches will be as they are fairly large projects, but here it goes:</p>

<h3>My top three elevator pitches would be:</h3>

<p>1. For [Cell phone photography or any photographic device]</p>
<p>who [needs long term storage for photos]<\p>
<p>the [Photography Vault]<\p>
<p>is a [photography preservation tool]<\p>
<p>that [photos uploaded from phone to long term cloud storage for management and viewing in a browser.  Ownership of vault given to beneficiary upon death of user].<\p>
<p>Unlike [google photos where dormant accounts are deleted after two years]
  our product [preserves a clear path for ownership of virtual property to the next generation].</p>

<p>2. For [any person]<\p>
<p>who [would like to see the best arguments pro/con on any idea or product]<\p>
<p>the [Arena of Ideas]<\p>
<p>is a [debate platform]<\p>
<p>that [gives every side of a debate or issue the ability to rate and vote for top arguments for competing ideas.  Every poster will need to give the top strengths/weaknesses of his ideas].</p>
<p>Unlike [websites like Redditt or Facebook that are echo chambers on single sided ideas or are moderated on single side ideals]
our product [will, over time, have the pros and cons of ideas or creeds listed side by side with all sides cross checked and cross examined].</p>

<p>3. For [a business owner or individual]<\p>
<p>who [who would be able to use a food product needing to be used or disposed]<\p>
<p>the [Produce Truck]<\p>
<p>is a [food products disposal clearinghouse]<\p>
<p>that [gives producers a place to list commercial sized amounts of food that are available].<\p>
<p>Unlike [sending it to landfills, which happens in large cities (I know firsthand)]<\p>
<p>our product [offers a central clearinghouse for purchasers a place to bid on food products that are near expiration date.  Maybe a cannery, or frozen food, or pig farm may be able to use the item].</p>
